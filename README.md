Memento is an application for enhancing the learning process. It is inspired by the spaced repetition technique.

In traditional spaced repetition software, you answer questions and postpone reviewing them for a certain number of days. As an alternative, Memento uses the number of questions as a measurement of delay. This is an experimental approach to spaced repetition.

There is also a difference in the evaluation process. Rather than evaluating yourself, you input your answers in Memento and train your muscle memory. It makes the learning process even more natural while adding an element of gamification.
