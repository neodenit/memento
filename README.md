#Memento

Memento is an application for educational purposes. It is inspired by spaced repetition approach and intended to improve human memory.

Classical spaced repetition software lets you evaluate your answers and postpone them to a certain ammount of time. Memento is using the number of other questions as a measure of delay. This is an experimental approach to space repetition.

Instead of asking you to evaluate yourself Memento provide you with opportunity to type in your answer. It helps you to practice answering in a natural fashion. This feature may be disabled if needed.

Some optimizations were made to support these experimental features.

#Manual
